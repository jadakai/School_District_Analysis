# School District Analysis

## Overview

After conducting a school district analysis, reports showed that academic dishonesty was discovered in the math and reading scores of Thomas High School 9th graders. The previous analysis must be adjusted by replacing the math and reading scores for the ninth grade students. The scores will be replaced with "NaN" values and the analysis will be conducted again.

## Analysis Results
