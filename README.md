# School District Analysis

## Overview

After conducting a school district analysis, reports showed that academic dishonesty was discovered in the math and reading scores of Thomas High School 9th graders. The previous analysis must be adjusted by replacing the math and reading scores for the ninth grade students. The scores will be replaced with "NaN" values and the analysis will be conducted again.

## Analysis Results

* Percentage of students passing according to math scores
* Percentage of students passing according to reading scores
* Overall percentage of students who passed both math and reading
* Percentage passing math, reading, and overall by budget per student
* Percentage passing math, reading, and overall by school size
* Placement of schools overall by score values relative to each other
